        <p>
            I have completed a bachleor's degree in Computer Science by PUC Minas. During the 4 years of college I developed several small projects (mostly in C++ and Java) that include many of the most poupular data structures, such as lists, binary trees and stacks. I also developed more complex projects that include an OCR made in C++ that uses two types of classifers (SVM and Neural Network), also using Machine Learning I developed a simple classifer for sentiment analyses of movie reviews. My Final project, which was written as a paper and published in WorldCist'23, "Identifying Valid User Stories Using BERT Pre-trained Natural Language Models" deals with a binary classification problem, it uses fine-tuned BERT models to process several texts and classify them as either a valid user story or an invalid one.

            Currently, I am taking a Graduate level class at UFMG about Information retrival. This deals with web crawling, indexing of documents and queries (alongside ranking of query results).
